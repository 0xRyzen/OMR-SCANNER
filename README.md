# OMR Scanner using Computer Vision
This project is an Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) scanner implemented using computer vision techniques in Python. It utilizes the Canny edge detection algorithm to process images and extract relevant information from scanned documents.

Features
Canny Edge Detection: The core algorithm used for image processing and edge detection.
Python Implementation: Developed entirely in Python, making it easy to understand and modify.
Scanning Capabilities: Able to scan and process images containing marked regions, such as answer sheets or checkboxes.
Customizable Parameters: Includes options to adjust parameters for better performance on different types of input images.
Simple Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
